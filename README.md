# kMeansMapReduce

This is an implementation of the K-Means algorithm via a Map-Reduce schema: the code is developed in Python and uses the adaptation commands of the Spark language. The steps of the implementation are available in the ```kmeans_presentation.ipynb``` file, while in ```kmeans_2D_final.ipynb``` one can find an application of the method for 2D generated data.

Final results are shown in ```benckmark.ipynb```, and allow the reader to see the performances of the implemented algorithm. Finally the Amdhal law is found to be consistent in the ```amdhal.png``` file.
